First, I created an Amazon AWS account. Within AWS, I chose to use the EC2 resource, which is a web service that provides cloud computing and make it easier and convenient to develop servers on the cloud. By creating an instance on EC2, I am assigned an IP on a computer somewhere off in a different location, which is always listening for a request. After creating the instance, I am given a key which is used to access that computer and use its terminal. From the terminal on my own device, I use the command "$ ssh -i ~/location/of/key/on/local/machine/key.pem ubuntu@ipaddress" and that gets me into the terminal of the computer running the instance. From there, I change my directory into the folder I wish to work in and then run node server.js (after installing all the necessaries modules). After all that, the server should be up and running. To make it accessible to anyone, the IP address must be open to all gates and not just my local computer. To do this, you go into the description section of the running instance which can be found below. Scroll down to the "Security Groups" and click "launch-wizard-1". Scroll down and click the "Inbound" tab and there will be a list of protocols, sources, and port ranges. Click edit and then add a rule. Select the TCP protocol and  a port range. The source must be set to 0.0.0.0/0 to be accessible from any device. After saving those settings, the instance is live and accessible from any device.
